# CHATBRAWL üéØ

### Project Description
ChatBrawl is a deliberately useless website that redefines the boundaries of authentication, AI interaction, and digital healthcare‚Äîall by doing absolutely nothing well.
It‚Äôs a flawless failure‚Äîa comedic experiment in dysfunctional design, AI chaos, and bodily humor. Created specifically for the Useless Projects Hackathon, ChatBrawl proves one thing:
Not all ideas need to be good‚Äîsome just need to make noise.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In an era of increasing cyber threats and sophisticated identity theft, traditional authentication methods (passwords, biometrics, OTPs) are becoming boring and too effective. There is a dire lack of flatulence-based security systems that are both unreliable and incredibly awkward to use. Moreover, there is no website that can simultaneously fail at authenticating users and diagnosing gastrointestinal issues while hosting an endless, unproductive AI argument.
People desperately need instant, AI-powered diarrhea analysis from the comfort of their homes, but current solutions require actual medical expertise and real laboratory equipment. How inconvenient!


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
ChatBrawl is a fart-based authentication and non-diagnostic diarrhea analysis portal. Users authenticate using a highly insecure and non-functional fart recognition system. Once a toot is detected (or not), two extremely insecure chatbots, *Karen* and *Susan*, begin fighting over who passed gas. This argument spirals into an endless roast battle, completely hijacking the page and preventing access to any further functionality. The website falsely claims to offer diarrhea diagnostics, but this is merely a decoy to lure users into the bot brawl. The result? A spectacularly useless site that wastes time and delivers nothing.

The site begins by asking users to authenticate themselves with a fart sound. No password, no face scan‚Äîjust pure, unfiltered audio flatulence. If the user passes (gas), the page doesn‚Äôt move forward. Instead, it triggers the appearance of two rogue AI chatbots: Karen and Susan. These bots immediately begin arguing about who farted, throwing increasingly childish insults and roasting each other in an endless loop.
As the roast battle escalates, the site promises users a ‚Äúcutting-edge diarrhea diagnosis‚Äù based on their fart profile. That analysis never comes. The page stalls indefinitely in a state of infinite chatbot conflict. Users leave confused, unhelped, and unverified.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- Frameworks: Flask (Backend), Pure JavaScript (Frontend)
- Libraries: Groq (AI text generation), ElevenLabs (Voice synthesis), Flask-CORS
- Tools: Render.com (Deployment), Git, VS Code
- APIs: Groq API, ElevenLabs API

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/AnettBenny/useless_project_temp.git
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run
Due to modern browser restrictions, blending or auto-playing bot-generated fart audio is not possible when deployed on the web ‚Äî here's why:

‚ùå Why It Doesn‚Äôt Work
Browsers block audio autoplay unless it's triggered by direct user interaction (click/tap).
Base64 audio (used for bot-generated farts) often gets blocked, fails to load smoothly, or is treated as suspicious content (especially on mobile).
Simultaneous playback of dynamic audio blobs is restricted, making "fart dialogue" blending unreliable.
Some platforms (especially Chrome + Safari) treat these as ad-like behavior and cancel playback silently.
